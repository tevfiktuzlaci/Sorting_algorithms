A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.
I made Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort with visual studio 2017 (form app)
